# Regression Models in Terror Management Studies

### Abstract

Conventional statistical methods used in terror management theory research were assessed in order to 
determine possible refinements. A published article was sourced from Frontiers in Psychology and 
the accompanying primary research data was found on an open data repository. A variety of multiple
linear regression models were assessed. Ordinal variables were analysed as metric, ordinal and binary 
data. Models that treated the ordinal data as metric either failed to detect interaction effects or inverted 
coefficient signs. The best fit was produced by a program developed specifically for ordinal predictor 
variables. Although conventional analysis methods in this field were found to be suboptimal, all valid 
models in this study confirmed the conclusions reported in the published article.
